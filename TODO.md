# Plugin Audit TODO

- [x] Update `package.json` to declare plugin type correctly (should use `elizaos:plugin:1.0.0` rather than project type)
- [x] Provide `.env.example` with required variables documented in README for easier configuration
- [x] Replace direct `process.env` access with runtime settings and plugin configuration (see `src/plugin.ts` lines 203-218)
- [x] Add authentication/authorization for RSS HTTP endpoints (currently open in `RSSServerService`)
- [x] Expand test coverage for failure cases in `TwitterRSSService.processAllLists`
- [x] Add CI workflow for linting and testing to ensure code quality
- [x] Configure ESLint and Prettier for consistent formatting
- [x] Document plugin actions, providers and HTTP endpoints in README
- [x] Implement graceful shutdown to stop scheduler and server services
- [x] Add changelog and release process documentation
- [ ] Use versioned branches for `agent-twitter-client` as recommended (see Discord link)
